# Assignment 1.05: User Interface with NCurses

## Description
In this project, we updated the user interface by using a library called
NCurses. This really made the UI feel much more like a game.

## Usage
Same usage as past projects.

Run `make` to build the project

Run `./generate_dungeon` to play the game
