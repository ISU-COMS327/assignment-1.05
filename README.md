# Assignment 1.04: Player Character and Monsters

## Description
In this project, I implemented functionality to simulate a game. The player
moves around randomly, and attempts to attack any nearby monsters. There are
16 different types of monsters that are seeking to attack the player. If the
player dies, the game is over. If all the monsters are dead and the player is
alive, then the player wins.

## Usage
You can see the [usage from my last project] (https://github.com/ISU-COMS327/assignment-1.03#usage)
for similar usage on this project. The only new usage information is the
`--nummon` flag. This details how many monsters should spawn.

Example: `--nummon=50`

The game will output which monsters have been created and their speed.
